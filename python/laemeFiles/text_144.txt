{=The song is written over seven manuscript lines, each line\n
consisting of music, English text, Latin text, adjusted to fit. The\n
fifth, sixth and seventh lines - the last two being the refrain - are\n
short and the scribe has written muscial instructions in Latin at the\n
right hand side of these lines. I transcribe all the Latin below the\n
English verse=}  \n

{=See Platzer (1995) for arguments in favour of reading this as a loan from\n
Latin \'vertere\' with the meaning "move to and fro". I find this sense rather\n
weak and the arguments for \'vertere\' and against \'fertan\' unconvincing and\n
non-sequential. The argument that <u/v> is rare at this date for earlier\n
initial f- in Reading (or the sister cell Leominster) is not right.\n
Proportions of <v/u> and <f> tell us less about whether voicing was more or\n
less present in the spoken language than they do about scribal attitude\n
(parsimony vs. profligacy) to system. The use of <v/u> rather then historic\n
<f> is rarely necessary for disambiguation and so not all scribes employed\n
<v/u> or if they did it need not be consistently. In the only other\n
English in Harley 978 - a list of Latin plant names and their English equivalents,\n
(written in a different hand from \'Cuckoo\' and not considered by\n
Platzer) there are six examples of word or syllable initial <u/v> for earlier\n
f- beside 26 <f>. The use of <u/v> was clearly possible in English at\n
the time and place of copying of \'Cuckoo\'=}\n
