{=The verse is written at the foot of the folio in two columns of six\n
short lines. Rough squiggles are used as line fillers to even up the text\n
blocks. The hand and rubrication are the same as that on the rest of\n
fol. 102v and on 103r (both Latin) (MB pers. comm.)=} \n

{=Large red initial *V taking up two lines depth=}\n
{=This reading is to a certain extent conjectural, but a best guess. The\n
*V is a plain large capital very like a modern Roman capital V. It is\n
supported by the presence of a marginal guide letter V. The second\n
letter looks superficially very like the symbol used for Y (in HYS\n
three times in the poem). It is different from that used for thorn,\n
having a short first element and a second element sweeping widely to\n
the left. The letter is dotted in each case. But the second letter in\n
"when" shows signs of being tampered with, the sweeping tail being\n
added later and not quite joining. If this were the case, the original\n
letter would almost certainly have been V and I therefore conjecture\n
that the dot may well have been supplied later too. Presumably the\n
scribe began with VEN leaving a gap for the initial *V in order that\n
together they would produce VV = W. Either he thought better of it, or\n
some other corrector misunderstood, and tried to change the letter to\n
a wynn (which one would have to suppose was identical to Y in his\n
script) after which confusion was worse confounded with the addition\n
of the capital *V. The scribe does not use wynn anywhere else in the\n
poem, which (although short) has a number of contexts where it would\n
have been possible, but he writes W in each case. I am inclined\n
therefore to assume it was a different scribe who tampered with the\n
letter. If this hypothesis is right, then *VV restores the original\n
intended reading=}\n
