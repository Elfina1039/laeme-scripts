{=Onions thinks this is for "thou give us to". Grammatically one can see the\n
point, because an imperative is required and the +TU is redundant anyway\n
with the preceding yU. But formally this explanation is completely\n
implausible because it requires one to take +ES for "us" and +TU for\n
post-poned "to" - neither spelling being phonetically explicable nor\n
paralleled. *IUESTU is fine for \'thou givest\'. MB thinks (and so do I)\n
that it\'s more likely that the scribe has switched in mid-stream from an\n
imperative "thou give" to a present "givest thou". Cf. "forgive us thou"\n
below with the +TU crossed through to make the imperative good=}\n

$/P21Oi_US\n
{=MB conjectures (pers com) that AL KILT may be a mistake for contracted\n
AKILT "aguilts". The contracted form is formally acceptable, but AL\n
may simply be a somewhat awkward use of the commonly appearing\n
adverbial "all, entirely". The whole phrase may be a corruption of\n
the more common plural version "as we forgive all those who (have) guilt(ed)\n
(i.e. trespass(ed) against) us". Given the common use of the past tense\n
in other versions of this phrase: "have guilted us", AL could perhaps\n
alternatively be a corruption of some form of "have" and KILT would then\n
have begun life as a past participle. AL could then have begun life as\n
Ay or AT. AS (for HAS) would be an easier error to account for, but -S\n
ending is not likely in Salisbury at this date. Or if it were\n
subjunctive it could possibly be AF which might also be easier to\n
account for palaeographically. I am dependent on MB\'s transcript; he has\n
yer E. But my own feeling would be that yer - i.e. thorn with a hook -\n
is used in the same way as a barred thorn - i.e. for "that" rather than\n
for "there/where" (cf. scribe of Cotton Caligula A.ix (many examples)\n
and hands A (6 exx) and D (2 exx) of Cambridge Trinity College 323. I\n
conjecture that it is also possible if the gap in the MS is not too\n
great (and MB confirms that it isn\'t) that the <E> could be part of\n
the "that" relative pronoun. I haven\'t come across hooked thorn in\n
combination with E for "that" but there is a number of examples of\n
barred thorn in combination with E. e.g. Lambeth Homilies has y~E\n
once for relative pronoun, FORdON-y~E once for the conjunction, and\n
conversely, with bar instead of hook, y~E once for "there" adverb.\n
Hand B of Lambeth 487 (Ureisun of ure lauerde) has y~E once for\n
"thee" and y~ET once for demonstrative "that". The Nero text of\n
Ancrene Riwle has y~E once for the demonstrative and twice for\n
relative pronoun plural and there is one example of y~E demonstrative\n
pronoun in the late 12th cent. text of the Vision of St Edwin in BL\n
Add 15340 from Winchester. I have provisionally therefore tagged the\n
combination yer and E as relative pronoun. I have not tried to emend\n
the text further, although the AL remains awkward=}\n
